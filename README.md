### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Halefom

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Full Stack Developer at EMG Consulting and as a Frontend Developer at Ray Technologies.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning TypeScript and Next.js to enhance my skills as a React developer. TypeScript's static typing and other features can help me improve code quality and maintainability, while Next.js can help me build server-side rendered React applications with ease. I'm excited to apply these new skills to my work and explore new possibilities with React.
